# Simple-G29-CARLA-Adapter
Its a simple ROS2 joy node based adapter for CARLA Simulator that translates the Logitech G29 steering wheel's steering, throttle and brake into data that CARLA understands, there is no force feedback or anything. You also need [Joy](https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers/tree/ros2/joy) to run it

How to use it:

Go into your ROS2 workspace's src folder and clone the repository (This code assumes its 'ros2_ws')

`cd ros2_ws/src/`
